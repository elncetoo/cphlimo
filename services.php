Transfer Services, A to B Services or Point to Point Service, it is all the same</p>
<p>A vast part of limousine services and chauffeur drive services that are carried out are simply transfer services or point to point services. Most notably you will see pick up of clients from the airport and going down town or perhaps onwards to the cruise ships (for more on our cruise ship work &#8211; please see here).</p>
<p>Utilizing limousine service or chauffeur drive service from Copenhagen Limousine Service makes great sense and eases the travelling enormously.</p>
<p>We monitor your flight arrival and make sure that we will be there to pick you up when you arrive. Should your flight come early or indeed be delayed, we will adjust our schedules so as to be there for your pick up when you will actually arrive.</p>
<p>You do not need to know about directions to your hotel, the cruise ship or the company that you are visiting, we will take care of that along with your luggage. You can just sit back comfortably and let our professional drivers take care of the rest.</p>
<p>And are you going from meeting to meeting in around town or elsewhere, you do not need to worry about finding the fewer and fewer parking spaces available, but can be rest assured that we will help you keep your schedule and important appointments of your Road Show. (for more on Road Shows &#8211; see here).</p>
<p>Whether you are travelling in Denmark or indeed elsewhere in the world Copenhagen Limousine Service can help you with your transportation needs.</p>

						<p>Copenhagen Limousine Service and our sister company The Private Car Company carries out Pendler Services too.</p>
<p>You may not realize it, but several companies are actually already finding the great value of utilizing us for the daily commute between home and work, or simply one location to the other or the transport from airport to hotel or vice versa on a daily basis.</p>
<p>By having a professional driver to take care of the actual driving you are freed up mentally and physically to make better use of your time yourself, whether be it for prepairing for your day, upcoming meetings or simply to relax a little bit either before your hectic day commences or after your work day ends.</p>
<p>Several companies have engaged us to carry out these chauffeur drive services for them on a daily basis and some even with up to several scheduled trips a day. Most notably you will thus also see that we handle a number of crew services (see crew services here).</p>
<p>For a company it can make great sense to make use of this offer from us, as this service eliminates the need to invest in an expensive company car for these purposes. Registration taxes in Denmark are very, very steep so there is a lot of money to be saved by looking into this option.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most companies do not really have the need for a car available to them all the time, not least have the need for a chauffeur sitting idly by to await the next needed trip. Using Copenhagen Limousine Service you will only pay for the actual need you have.</p>
<p>Finally, do you realize that utilizing a chauffeur in Denmark also means that no personal tax for a company car will be in effect? Thus the individual person can actually save a great deal in their personal income tax.</p>
<p>You are bound to find it a greater value than you expected and certainly less expensive than you might think.</p>
